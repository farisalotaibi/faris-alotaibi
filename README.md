## What features in the dataset do you think will help support your investigation into your feature(s) of interest?

### about me i think that trip duration is highly dependent on the start stations and end stations, more crowded places should receive more rides so some stations should be logging more duration sec. I also think user_type, birthyear and gender should also effect trip duration.
